## Usage
The decision-making system (DMS) is used by E-Market, considering products it has to offer thus giving corresponding recommendations of products to buy. The relevance of wares depends on rules and exceptions that test coverage contains in itself, which means users will get recommendations based upon standards of the DMS.
